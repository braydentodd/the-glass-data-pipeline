- games_played, minutes_x10, possessions, fg2m, fg2a, fg3m, fg3a, ftm, fta
- off_reb_pct_x1000, def_reb_pct_x1000, assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, fouls
- off_rating_x10, def_rating_x10, off_rebounds, def_rebounds

GROUP 2: Shooting Tracking - Per Player (playerdashptshots)
- ClosestDefenderShooting result set filtered by shot zones:
  - Restricted Area: open_rim_fgm/fga (4-6ft + 6+ft), cont_rim_fgm/fga (0-2ft + 2-4ft)
  - In The Paint Non-RA + Mid-Range: open_mr_fgm/fga, cont_mr_fgm/fga
  - Above The Break 3 + Corner 3: cont_fg3m/fga, open_fg3m/fga
- ~600 players × 0.6s = 6 min

GROUP 3: Playmaking Tracking - Per Player (playerdashptpass)
- PassesMade result set: pot_ast
- PassesReceived result set: touches

- ~600 players × 0.6s = 6 min

GROUP 5: Putbacks - Per Player (playerdashboardbyshootingsplits)
- ShotTypePlayerDashboard result set: sum Putback + Tip shots → putbacks
- ~600 players × 0.6s = 6 min

GROUP 6: Hustle Stats - League Wide (leaguehustlestatsplayer - 1 call total)
- charges_drawn, deflections, contests
- 1 call gets all players

GROUP 7: Defense Tracking - League Wide (leaguedashptdefend - 3-4 calls total)
- Call with DribbleRange filter for different zones:
  - Overall: def_fg2m/fga, real_def_fg_pct (real_def_fg_pct is DFG_PCT from this)
  - Less Than 6 Ft: def_rim_fgm/fga
  - 3 Pointers: def_fg3m/fga
- 3-4 calls total (merge results by player_id)

GROUP 8: On-Off Ratings - Per Team (teamplayeronoffdetails)
- Filter rows where GROUP_VALUE = "Off" for each player
- tm_off_off_rating_x10, tm_off_def_rating_x10
- ~30 teams × 1s = 30s
